# Introduction 
Frosti's goal is to enable devs to abstract the step of infrastructure provisioning entirely and simply write their applicaiton code. Our infrastructure interpreter scans the applicaiton and automatically provisions the optimal infrastructure for each enviornment. Think of us as Python or Java as compared to C. For a lot of solutions, the simplicity of the language outweighs the performance hit.

See www.frostibuild.com for more info.

# Local Development
Written for dotnet. If you have Visual Studio, this should be as easy as cloning the repo.

# Contributing
We would love any and all help in furthering the project. We truly believe infrastrucutre can be abstracted away for a lot of cloud solutions.

# Business Thoughts
We are currently charging $10 for a beta. We are trying to go full time to work on this project, and this is one things investors like to see. We are not sure what part of the project will actually require a paid premium, but our focus is on enterprises only. We want individual developers to have access to the entire project free of charge!

# ToDo
 - Add support for AWS/GCP
 - Possible to make the interrpreters/connectors cloud agnostic?
 - Add support for more languages (Go, Node, Python, Java...)
 - Add more services for Azure
 - Start working on a stable prod env
 - Move az to use terraform (multi-cloud support via terraform/pulumi?)
